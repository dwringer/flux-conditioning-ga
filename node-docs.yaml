description: Use a crossover/mutation operation on a population of FLUX prompt conditioning objects
keywords: [node, invokeai, python, stablediffusion]
requirements:
  - invokeai>=4
intro: |
  This node takes a collection of prompt Conditioning objects for FLUX and applies a selected genetic algorithm operation to their embedding tensors, with an optional mutation that perturbs elements of the prompt embeddings at random.

  Certain input fields are used only with certain selected crossover modes. Please see the tooltips/inputs documentation for more details.

  ### Installation:

  To install these nodes, simply place the folder containing this
  repository's code (or just clone the repository yourself) into your
  `invokeai/nodes` folder.
